# WebCalculator project

A simple application with four pages, with very simple logic (the simplest calculator). 
Implemented using Spring Boot in Java, also wrote some unit tests and UI tests in BDD approach.

**The main purpose of this project is in the future to be embedded in pipelines based on 
various technologies to provide CI/CD. For this I will try to use several approaches, 
from a simple one based on Jenkins and dedicated servers to deploy the application, 
to cloud services with a flexible infrastructure described in the code.**

Key points for future implementation
1. Static code analysis
2. Unit tests
3. UI tests
4. All necessary servers or containers
5. Automatic deployment/testing/merging
6. Reporting
